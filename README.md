# Greenhouse-Sensor-System

## Project Overview
This project was created as a part of the Renewable Energy Scholars Club at Bucknell University. In efforts to restore an old greenhouse on campus, they are implementing sensors to track various enviornmental data. So far the data includes the following:
- Temperature
- Humidity
  
They are using an Adafruit Feather M4 Express, an Adafruit Airlift Featherwing, and various sensors to collect and send data to thingspeak (an online platform for saving a analyzing data)

To see how we implemented this look at [GettingStarted.md](https://github.com/curtisprogramming/Greenhouse-Sensor-System/blob/main/GettingStarted.md)
